The two .cs files uploaded based on the two problems

1. Write a function (in any language) which takes 'n' as an argument and prints all the numbers from 1 to 'n', except that: (a) if a number is divisible by 3, it should print 'Hip' instead of the number, (b) if divisible by 5 it should print 'Hop', and (c) if divisible by 3 & 5, it should print 'Whazaa' instead of the number.

2. Given an input FILE consisting of numbers separated by spaces, write a program which displays the frequency distribution for the given input.
